Desktop Notifications browser extension
=======================================

This browser extension provides native desktop notifications for Linux
desktop environments (eg. GNOME or KDE) using libnotify.

To build the extension from a release tarball, the usual autotool procedure
should be followed:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install

If you're building from a Git clone, run the autogen.sh script instead
of the configure one. The autogen.sh script will run the configure script
for you, unless the NOCONFIGURE environment variable is set to a non-empty
value.
